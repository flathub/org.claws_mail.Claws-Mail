The flathub recipe for building Claws-mail as a flatpak distributable package.

## TODO

Reminders for later consideration.

- BUG: bogofilter binary is not available, so bogofilter plug-in fails on use.
- TODO: create .desktop file.
- TODO: create screenshots.
- TODO: Align exact versions of dependencies with packaging instructions for debian/ubuntu by Claws-Mail developers.
- TODO: Investigate if building for i386 is possible.
