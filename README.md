# Unofficial flatpak for [Claws-Mail](https://claws-mail.org)

`TODO: add description`

## TODO

Reminders for later consideration.

- TODO: Align exact versions of dependencies with packaging instructions for debian/ubuntu by Claws-Mail developers.
- BUG: bogofilter binary is not available, so bogofilter plug-in fails on use.
- Check if we can build for i686.
